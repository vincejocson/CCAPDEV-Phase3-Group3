## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CCAPDEV-Phases-Group3/Phase\ 2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**
   - Install MongoDB locally or set up MongoDB Atlas
   - Ensure MongoDB is running on `mongodb://localhost:27017/lab_reservation`
   - Or update the connection string in `app.js` and `seed/seed.js`

4. **Environment Variables (Optional)**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lab_reservation
   SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

5. **Seed the database**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

6. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
